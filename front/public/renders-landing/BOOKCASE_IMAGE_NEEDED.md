# Bookcase Placeholder Image Required

A placeholder image is needed for the bookcase product card in the product types list.

## Required Specifications:
- **Filename**: `bookcase-1.png`
- **Location**: `/front/public/renders-landing/bookcase-1.png`
- **Dimensions**: Approximately 2056x1000px (similar to other product images)
- **Content**: A rendered image or photo of a bookcase/library unit
- **Style**: Should match the style of existing product images (wardrobe-1.png, stand-1.png, etc.)

## Temporary Fallback:
Until a proper image is created, the system will attempt to load `bookcase-1.png`. If the image doesn't exist, it will show a broken image placeholder or the blurred placeholder defined in the ProductTypesList component.

## Creation Steps:
1. Create or render a bookcase image showing shelves (open or with doors)
2. Resize/crop to ~2056x1000px
3. Save as `bookcase-1.png` in `/front/public/renders-landing/`
4. Delete this README file
